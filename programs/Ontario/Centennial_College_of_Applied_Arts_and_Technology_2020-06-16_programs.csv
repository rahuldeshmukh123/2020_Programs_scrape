                            The School of Community and Health Studies offers the Addiction and Mental Health Worker program. It will help you acquire the education to work in mental health and addiction services using evidence-based knowledge and skills in screening, assessing, and responding to people with mental health and substance-use issues from diverse cultural and community perspectives.

In Addiction and Mental Health Work courses, you'll learn to work — in a variety of community health and human services settings such as mental health and addiction agencies, homeless drop-in centres and crisis service centres — with individuals, family members and small groups impacted by addiction and mental health issues. You'll also gain the knowledge to advocate for equitable access to supports and services including health promotion, prevention and harm reduction. The Addiction and Mental Health Work program has a commitment to reconciliation with Indigenous communities in Canada. As a result, courses will offer Indigenous perspectives to addiction and mental health work.

Classroom instruction will be combined with a second-year field placement experience during which you'll spend several days each week working with clients in social service agencies under the supervision of experienced service providers. You'll have the opportunity to work in interprofessional teams to gain direct experience providing support to clients and families through case management, assessment, referral and navigating systems of care. The practical experience you gain will help to reinforce classroom learning and provide grounding for full-time work after graduation.

Please Note: This program is taught using a combination of modalities. Courses may be delivered face-to-face, online or in blended/hybrid combination of both online and traditional classroom teaching.

This multidisciplinary two-semester post-graduate program — facilitated by the School of Communications, Media, Arts and Design in the hub of Toronto's film and television district — will be especially beneficial for writers, directors, producers, editors, actors, and other film and television craftspeople who want to expand their industry knowledge.

The major focus of the first semester will be on creating, pitching, outlining, developing, drafting and polishing production-ready short film scripts. During the second semester, you'll have the opportunity to prepare, perform in, shoot and/or post a number of these productions.

Additionally, Advanced Television and Film – Script to Screen will see you deconstructing classic films, television shows and scripts of all genres. The program will also provide advanced instruction from industry professionals in your major and minor areas of craft interest, along with extensive employment information.

Program Highlights

The Advanced Television and Film – Script to Screen program is unique among the few other post-graduate film and television offerings currently available in the Greater Toronto Area.
	Instead of immediately streaming you into master classes, the first semester will ensure you obtain a solid working knowledge of the various roles people have when working on a film or television production.
	The amount of included foundational lessons will allow you to better collaborate, improvise, problem-solve, and empathize with your fellow cast and crew members.
	The program will focus on dramatic filmmaking, comedy and several other genres. It will not, however, include documentary filmmaking.
	At a time when student films continue to be key to gaining a foothold in the business, the time and effort devoted to script development in Semester 1 and production and post-production in Semester 2 will result in higher quality student films than are customarily produced.

                            In the Child and Youth Care program, you'll develop the knowledge and skills to advocate for children, youth and their families as you learn to encourage them to be more resourceful and to confidently use their voices.

This three-year Child and Youth Care program will examine the principles, philosophies and characteristics of relational child and youth care practice from child and youth-centred, developmental and ecological perspectives (1). It will also cover themes related to professional boundaries, child and adolescent mental health, psychology, counselling theories, crisis theory, intervention and counselling (group, individual, family), abuse, advocacy and anti-oppression.

As a graduate of this advanced diploma program, you'll be ready to provide prevention and early intervention strategies, assessment, treatment, and counselling to children and adolescents who may be in crisis, struggling with psychological challenges, or who are dealing with other stressful situations. As such, you'll become a valuable member of the mental health profession and use your knowledge and skills to provide life-changing support from a strength-based paradigm.

Child and youth care practitioners engage and work with children, youth and their families across a wide variety of settings, including community-based child and youth development programs, parent education and family support, school-based programs, community mental health, group homes, residential centres, day and residential treatment programs, early intervention, home-based care and treatment, private practice, psychiatric centres, rehabilitation programs, paediatric health care, child protection and youth justice programs (2).

This program will be delivered using a combination of modalities. Courses may be taught face-to-face, online or in a blended/hybrid combination of both online and traditional classroom teaching.

(1) Adapted from Child & Youth Care Program Standards (2014), Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities.

(2) Settings adapted from the Association for Child and Youth Care Practice and Child and Youth Care Certification Board (2010), ""Competencies for Professional Child and Youth Work Practitioner"".

Program Highlights

The Child and Youth Care program may be taken full or part time, and if you are currently working in the field, through a government-funded apprenticeship program.
	The program curriculum is reviewed on an annual basis to ensure courses are up-to-date and based on current research and best practices.
	Program faculty are all trained in child and youth care and have extensive knowledge, expertise and field experience.
	Three specialized field practicums will be provided and include a variety of settings. The first-year field practicum will be in a school board setting and will occur two days per week in Semester 2. The second-year field practicum will be in a residential setting in either Semester 3 or 4 and will occur four days per week (shift work could include day and/or evening hours). The final practicum, three days per week during Semester 5 and 6, will be in a specialized setting. All three field practicums will provide a valuable opportunity for integrating classroom learning and hand-on practice.
	All graduates will receive certification in SafeTALK (Suicide Prevention), ASIST (Suicide Intervention) and Positive Space training.
	The Child and Youth Care program has a specially-designed communications lab that will be used extensively for interactive learning activities, counselling simulations, and small group observation and feedback.
	You'll have the opportunity to engage in intra-professional collaboration with other programs within the College community (e.g., Police Foundations).
	Global Citizenship and Equit (GC&E) Portfolio: You'll develop a portfolio documenting your engagement with the College's signature GC&E competencies. For more information on GC&E, the GC&E Portfolio and the supports available to you, please visit www.centennialcollege.ca/citizenshipandequity.

	Assess and respond to children and youths' strenths and needs, including complex responses impacted by developmental, environmental, physical, emotional, social and mental health challenges to promote positive change;
	Analyze and evaluate the impact of the interrelationship among family, social service, and justice and community systems on children, youth and their families, and use this information in planning holistic care and reducing systemic barriers;
	Plan, implement and evaluate interventions using evidence-informed practices in the areas of therapeutic milieu, programming and group work to promote resiliency and to enhance development in children, youth and their families;
	Advocate for the rights of children, youth and their families, and maintain an anti-oppression perspective and cultural competence in diverse cultural contexts;
	Apply communication, teamwork and organizational skills within the interprofessional team and with community partners to enhance the quality of service in child and youth care practice;
	Develop and implement self-care strategies using self-inquiry and reflection processes to promote self-awareness and to enhance practice as a child and youth care practitioner;
	Use evidence-based research, professional development resources and supervision models to support professional growth and lifelong learning.

                            You’re sitting at home, flipping through the channels on a lazy Sunday morning. You pause on a commercial for a new cartoon that will be premiering the following week and a smile creeps across your face. As you continue to watch the commercial, your smile gets wider as a sense of pride puffs your chest out a little. The commercial ends and you turn off the TV to take in the moment.

You just witnessed the very first commercial for a show you helped to produce, and you can’t help but feel elated.

Children’s media is a key component to the Canadian entertainment industry. With rapid growth of the market, the demand for trained professionals is growing with it. Luckily, Centennial College offers a one-of-a-kind program that allows you to build and develop just the right skills to enter this line of work. The Children’s Media program provides you with hands-on experience, and prepares you for various career paths in the industry.

In only 3 semesters, you will build the capabilities to create content for children’s media, as well as learn how to manage and market various products. You’ll learn and master the true art of storytelling and put it to work with script writing. Video production and project coordination will come by as second nature after you complete your first two semesters at Centennial College.

Your final semester is where all your skills get to shine during your work-placement period. This is your opportunity to find the area of children’s media that speaks to you! Whether it be in licensing and merchandising, or in the writer’s room, the Centennial College Children’s Media program will put you on the right path to getting there.

While in the program, you will receive front line experience in:
	Creating a brand plan
	Starting and developing content for a YouTube channel
	Working alongside a client relevant to the industry – Scholastics Canada being just one of the clients who partner with the students
	And so much more!
This will allow you to enter the workplace with a variety of experience in different sectors and completely understanding what to do in any situation. Graduates of this program have been known to be hired into the field within six months to a year of graduation, and two alumni received daytime Emmy nominations in 2018!

That moment you felt earlier after watching your first tv commercial will become a daily experience, and that experience will lead to so many more magical moments. With the Centennial College Children’s Media program, there are endless possible ways of how you can create the best moments for someone’s childhood.
