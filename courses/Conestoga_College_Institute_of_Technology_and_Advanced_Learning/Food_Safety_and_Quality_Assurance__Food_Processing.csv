This course provides in-depth coverage of the fundamental concepts of food safety, Preventive Control Plans (PCP) and how they assist in controlling the likelihood of introducing food safety hazards to the food product through the work environment and operational practices. Students will be introduced to the knowledge and skills required to enable them to establish and implement PCP. This course will provide a strong foundation for the later studies in hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP), and other globally recognized food safety management systems. This course provides in-depth coverage of food safety according to the Safe Food for Canadians Regulations (SFCR), Codex Alimentarius Basic Texts (WHO) and the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). Students will be introduced to the resources necessary to enable them to customize Preventive Control Plans (PCP) to meet industry specific requirements and regulations and industry best practices. The learner will be introduced to the skills required to identify, document and communicate food safety responsibilities for different job categories and the need for involvement and interactions between departments in a food organization (i.e. production management, maintenance, engineering, sanitation, product development, quality control, marketing, sales, production employees).Hours: 70Credits: 5Pre-Requisites: CoRequisites:"

"6","Conestoga College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning","Food Safety and Quality Assurance - Food Processing","https://www.conestogac.on.ca//fulltime/food-safety-and-quality-assurance-food-processing","FOOD8045","Food Microbiology","Description: This course combines lecture and hands on work in the laboratory and food manufacturing pilot plant facility. This course provides knowledge of the characteristics of common microorganisms of concern in the food industry, which will build a strong foundational knowledge to assist the students for later studies in conducting hazard analysis and risk assessments in developing HACCP plans. This course will also familiarize the learner with key information required to plan the design for construction of a food safety laboratory; purchase equipment; reagents and tools; develop documented procedures and microbiological food sampling plans for in-house testing for the food manufacturing industry. This course offers ample time for participants to develop the skills to become competent at a variety of microbiological food testing and environmental swabbing methods (e.g. Total Aerobic Plate Count, Coliform Plate Count, E. coli, ATP testing), which are commonly applied in an in-house food manufacturing lab. Participants will learn how to choose an independent accredited laboratory and how to send out food and swab samples for tests that are not performed in-house. Participants will become familiar with microbiological testing protocols to meet regulatory requirements and industry best practices for the food industry.

The food laws of various countries and regions are studied, with particular emphasis on laws that apply in Canada, the U.S and Europe. Some of the topics cover current regulatory initiatives, the regulation of food safety, the impact of genetic modification or bio-engineering of food on regulations, rules about additives, liability for food fraud, food, labelling regulations and other issues of concernHours: 42Credits: 3Pre-Requisites: CoRequisites:"

Specific methods for determining soils and choosing the best chemical agents for treatment and elimination, main causes of environmental cleanliness failure and the science base for choosing the most effective ways to perform and evaluate sanitary conditions will be presented. Proper use of and safe handling of chemicals, along with overall safety in sanitation will be practiced throughout the course. Methods of detection and correction will be explored from both a practical and theoretical point of view. Students will be assigned sanitation tasks and will use the knowledge gained to test various cleaning agents and different techniques to determine their efficacy by means of on-site inspections, microbiological and ATP swabbing on actual food manufacturing lines. Assignments will include the creation of a Master Sanitation Schedule for the pilot plant and SSOPs for the equipmentHours: 41Credits: 3Pre-Requisites: CoRequisites:"
