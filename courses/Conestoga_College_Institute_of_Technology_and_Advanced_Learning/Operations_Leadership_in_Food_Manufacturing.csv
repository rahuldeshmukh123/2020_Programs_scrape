This course provides in-depth coverage of the fundamental concepts of food safety, Preventive Control Plans (PCP) and how they assist in controlling the likelihood of introducing food safety hazards to the food product through the work environment and operational practices. Students will be introduced to the knowledge and skills required to enable them to establish and implement PCP. This course will provide a strong foundation for the later studies in hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP), and other globally recognized food safety management systems. This course provides in-depth coverage of food safety according to the Safe Food for Canadians Regulations (SFCR), Codex Alimentarius Basic Texts (WHO) and the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). Students will be introduced to the resources necessary to enable them to customize Preventive Control Plans (PCP) to meet industry specific requirements and regulations and industry best practices. The learner will be introduced to the skills required to identify, document and communicate food safety responsibilities for different job categories and the need for involvement and interactions between departments in a food organization (i.e. production management, maintenance, engineering, sanitation, product development, quality control, marketing, sales, production employees).Hours: 70Credits: 5Pre-Requisites: CoRequisites:"
