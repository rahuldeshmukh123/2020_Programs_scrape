The course provides and overview of the regulatory requirements associated with the Brownfield redevelopment process. The Phase I/II site assessment activities covered in detail in the Environmental Auditing and Site Assessment course is briefly reviewed and placed in context of the overall process. This course emphasizes Brownfield Site remediation activities that occur after site assessment and characterization is complete. The requirements of the most recent amended version of Record of Site Condition Regulation in relation to site remediation activities will be discussed and applied in the course.The students will complete a Remedial Action Plan (RAP) for a case study site. The RAP will include identification of potential remedial technologies, evaluation of the technical, economic, social, regulatory, and implementability aspects of each technology, and the selection of a preferred technology to cleanup contaminated soils and groundwater at the study site.The students will prepare tender specifications and drawings for the remediation of the study site. An evaluation of actual bids for a brownfield site remediation will be completed. The students will identify site management activities that are conducted during the construction phase of brownfield site remediation. Mock scenarios will be used to demonstrate situations and issues that can arise during the construction phase. The students will identify and distinguish between the roles and responsibilities of the owner, contractor, regulator, and consultants during site remediation activities.This course studies the processes and activities that occur at both rehabilitated Brownfield Sites and Greenfield Sites. Particular emphasis is placed on environmental issues such as storm water management and the impacts of development on groundwater resources.Hours: 42Credits: 3Pre-Requisites: CoRequisites: CIVL2040, ENVR8080"
