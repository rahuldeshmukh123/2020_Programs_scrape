The student will measure current and voltage in specific areas in circuits to determine other values such as power, percent loading, and efficiency. Students will abide by all Canadian Electrical Code rules as well as proper safety procedures.Hours: 42Credits: 2Pre-Requisites: ELEC2310CoRequisites:"

Students will incorporate the use of various types of field devices, process control techniques, as well as variable frequency drives (VFD's) to control three-phase induction motors. Students will develop PLC programs using a variety of manufacturers and languages such as ladder logic and function block. Various types of communication between components will also be studied in this course. The students will incorporate a variety of industrial automation concepts into a larger scale project that will utilize these components and concepts into a practical, relevant, and working application.Hours: 112Credits: 6Pre-Requisites: ELCN1060, ELEC2300, ELEC2310, ELEC3180 or ELEC3185, ELEC3190, INST1050, ELEC1395 or ELEC1397 or ELEC1900, ELEC1393CoRequisites:"
